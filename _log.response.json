Under the leadership of Jean-Christophe Antoine (read our <a href=\"https://worldpokerdeals.com/blog/exclusive-interview-with-jean-christophe-antoine-head-of-ggnetwork\">exclusive interview</a>), the site has become a model to follow in the gaming industry, and it will soon become the #1 poker site in the world&nbsp;after winning the <a href=\"http://worldpokerdeals.com/blog/ggnetwork-becomes-the-1-poker-site-in-the-world\">GGPoker vs PokerStars</a> battle.</p>\n<p>In this thorough review, we will expose all GG Poker secrets and make your life easy before signing up by answering the most frequently asked questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why is GGPoker on the way to the top?</li>\n<li>What makes GG Poker unique?</li>\n<li>Is GGPoker safe?</li>\n<li>How can I deposit and start playing?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>GGPoker rakeback</h2>\n<p>Suppose you want to play at GG Poker for <a href=\"https://worldpokerdeals.com/blog/what-is-rakeback-in-online-poker\">rakeback</a>. In that case, we have bad news for you: the site has developed effective measures to \"discourage\" rake machines, and although everyone gets a piece of the cake, regs definitely get a smaller one.</p>\n<p>Each month the site reveals new promotions in the form of leaderboards for all formats, and four jackpots are played at the cash tables (including Short Deck and All-in or Fold). Please note that most of the prizes will be paid with the \"local currency\" <a href=\"https://worldpokerdeals.com/blog/c-dollar-at-ggpoker-what-are-they\">Cash Game Dollars C$</a>.</p>\n<p>Besides such monthly promotions, GGPoker features a cashback program called Fish Buffet Rewards.</p>\n<p><img style=\"height: 300px; width: 640px;\" src=\"/uploads/GGPoker-Welcome-Bonus_1.jpg\" alt=\"GGPoker Welcome Bonus\" /></p>\n<p>You will be able to choose one of two welcome bonuses for your first deposit at GGPoker:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>100% matched bonus up to $600: paid in $5 chunks for every $20&nbsp;net rake (please check PVI rake), 90 days wagering time;</li>\n<li>Up to $100 in cash and free tickets: all rewards will expire after 30 days</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Attention!</strong> You cannot clear the bonus cash at Rush &amp; Cash (fast-fold poker) tables.</p>\n<p><strong>How to get the GGPoker welcome bonus?</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://worldpokerdeals.com/rakeback-deals/ggpoker-download\">Download GGpoker</a>&nbsp;and register an account;</li>\n<li>Deposit at least $20 and choose a bonus from the dropdown menu;</li>\n<li>$600 matched bonus:&nbsp;your account will be credited with a bonus balance according to your deposit.</li>\n<li>$100 in rewards:&nbsp;you'll get free tickets up to $40 during the following six days, and $60 in additional rewards for playing;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>GGPoker gives up to $300 in extra bonuses for new players in the <strong>Honeymoon for Newcomers</strong> promotion.</p>\n<p>Daily challenges will be assigned for 30 days; tasks include playing a&nbsp;specific number of hands or winning a jackpot. Please note that you must opt-in the client to benefit from this bonus.</p>\n<h2>Fish Buffet</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/GGPokerOK-Fish-Buffet.jpg\" alt=\"GGPoker Fish Buffet\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://worldpokerdeals.com/blog/fish-buffet-update-and-other-changes-at-ggpoker-in-march-2021\">Fish Buffet</a> is a semi-random cashback program rewarding all players taking part in real money games at GGPoker. It's designed to be complex. Although it tries to attract regs with massive rakeback promotions up to 60%, the reality is that there is no way to know how much you will receive in return at the end of the day. All of this thanks to PVI rake (more on this later).</p>\n<p>Players get Fish Buffet Points (FP) at a rate of 100 FP for every $1 \"paid in rake,\" affected by PVI, of course. Eight levels divided into 25 ranks compose Fish Buffet. Grinders can switch to a Platinum Status, giving a \"flat cashback\" from 20% to 60% for the top rank: GGPlatinum. Each time you rank up, you can spin a wheel with random prizes.</p>\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>rank</td>\n<td>REWARDS</td>\n<td>AVERAGE RAKEBACK</td>\n<td>\n<p>FP REQUIRED</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Platinum Fish</td>\n<td>$1 for 500 FP</td>\n<td>20%</td>\n<td>\n<p>not required</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Platinum Octopus</td>\n<td>$1 for 285 FP</td>\n<td>35%</td>\n<td>750Ðš</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Platinum Whale</td>\n<td>$1 for 200 FP</td>\n<td>50%</td>\n<td>1,5M</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Platinum Shark</td>\n<td>$1 for 182 FP</td>\n<td>55%</td>\n<td>3M</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>GGPlatinum</td>\n<td>$1 for 167 FP</td>\n<td>60%</td>\n<td>5M</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Overall, Fish Buffet is a cashback program designed for casual players. It's not possible to know how much you will receive from it, even in the so-called \"flat cashback\" ranks, so we recommend our grinders not to pay much attention to this and just spin the wheel when the time come.</p>\n<p><strong>PRO tip</strong>: our customers get access to a profitable rake race after signing up with us. Our manager will provide more details, but we can say in advance that grinders get massive returns.</p>\n<h2>GGPoker rake</h2>\n<p>GG Poker charges a 5% rake with caps from 0,5bb to 2bb.</p>\n<p><strong>Did you make a 3-bet preflop? You will pay rake too. The comission is taken preflop from all pots more than 2.5BB.</strong></p>\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>stakes</td>\n<td>NLH</td>\n<td>\n<p>PLO and PLO5</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$0.01 / $0.02</td>\n<td>$0,2</td>\n<td>$0,06</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$0.02 / $0.05</td>\n<td>$0,5</td>\n<td>$0,15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$0.05 / $0.10</td>\n<td>$1</td>\n<td>$0,30</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$0.10 / $0.25</td>\n<td>$2</td>\n<td>$0,75</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$0.25 / $0.50</td>\n<td>$4</td>\n<td>$1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$0.50 / $1</td>\n<td>$5</td>\n<td>$2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$1 / $2</td>\n<td>$6</td>\n<td>$4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$2 / $5</td>\n<td>$8</td>\n<td>$7,5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$5 / $10</td>\n<td>$10</td>\n<td>$15</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>No rake will be charged at the fast-fold poker (Rush &amp; Cash) tables if the table is not complete.</p>\n<p>At spins and MTTs, the sake is standard. Tournaments: about 10% + 0,5% of the prize as admin fee in some events.</p>\n<p>Spin &amp; Gold fee: 7%&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>GGPoker doesn't have a friendly rake structure. Although a capped 5% commission looks ok, raking preflop pots is non-standard. It's also the only site charging \"Admin Fees\" in MTT series. However, many players are unaware or are just willing to pay the price to access such a massive soft field. And we have not yet started with PVI.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>PVI rake</h3>\n<p>Player Value Index or PVI is a \"secret formula\" that redistributes the rake paid at the tables according to many situations. We have explained all <a href=\"https://worldpokerdeals.com/blog/pvi-or-rakeback-on-the-good-game-network\">GGPoker PVI rake</a> details, but let's share some highlights here:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>No one knows the real PVI indicator. The site doesn't share this information with players or affiliates</li>\n<li>Winning regs have a lower PVI (0.1 is the lowest one), and amateurs have better ones (2 is the biggest possible)</li>\n<li>Any behavior at the table affects PVI: deposits, withdrawals, profits, overlays, time played, skill level, games, etc.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Although we consider transparent rake structures and distribution methods better for the overall industry, GG Poker has proved that this approach does not scare players and benefit the ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Telegram</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://telegram.me/wpd_support_en_bot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wpd-support</a></p>\n<p><strong>Skype</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=\"skype:28:dea5daa0-ccbc-4ec3-8c74-eda5da7ee5cf?chat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wpd-support-skype</a></p>\n<p><strong>Email</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:help@worldpokerdeals.com\">help@worldpokerdeals.com</a></p>\n<p><strong>WhatsApp</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wa.me/905340740558\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">+905340740558</a></p>\n<p>%actions%</p>\n<h2>Games and traffic</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Average online 100000</li>\n<li>Best time to play 14:00 GMT+3</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img style=\"height: 512px; width: 750px;\" src=\"/uploads/ggpoker games.jpg\" alt=\"ggpoker cash games\" /></p>\n<p>GGPoker is on its way to the top of online poker. Industry experts think that it's only a matter of time until it steadily crowns as the TOP1 site at PokerScout. Exciting features like straddle, run it twice, rabbit hunt, and all-in insurance are available across all games.</p>\n<p>We highlight the presence of nosebleed games up to NL/PLO100k, a millionaire tournament grid, spin &amp; go, and unique games like All-in or fold. All formats offered at the lobby are usually crowded by players 24/7. It's common to see over 100,000 connections.</p>\n<h3>Cash Games: Hold'em, Omaha, Fast-fold, AOF</h3>\n<p>GGPoker is one of the few sites where the <a href=\"https://worldpokerdeals.com/blog/best-plo-poker-sites-where-to-play-pot-limit-omaha\">Omaha poker PLO</a> action is similar to Hold 'em. Hundreds of games are available around the clock. Every day, more poker players come to the tables attracted by the outstanding traffic indicators.</p>\n<p>The number of tables at low and mid-stakes exceeds 100, and over 20 high stakes games can be spotted during the peak time. VIP games are available for high rollers with $500/$1,000/$2,000 blinds.</p>\n<p><strong>Rush &amp; Cash (fast-fold poker)</strong></p>\n<p>Rush &amp; Cash is the local version of fast-fold poker, a successful format launched under the name of Zoom by PokerStars; the action is measured by the number of connections per stake. Fast-fold Hold 'em games start at NL2 to NL200, and over 500 players play during the prime time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://worldpokerdeals.com/blog/rush-cash-omaha-all-about-the-new-ggnetwork-game\">Rush &amp; Cash Omaha</a> features more than 300 connections around the clock, and it's played at the same stakes as Hold 'em.</p>\n<p><strong>Short Deck (6+ Hold 'em)</strong></p>\n<p>GGPoker is perhaps the only major poker site in which 6+ Hold 'em has become popular. Although the traffic isn't great, low-stakes players won't have any problem finding an open seat in one of the 25 tables available. There are games available for up to $10, and the button ante rule applies. Flush beats a full house.</p>\n<p><strong>All-in or Fold</strong></p>\n<p>AoF is preferred by many amateurs who join the games looking for the non-stopping action that this game offers. The bets are placed using the \"button-ante\" system: all players put a mandatory bet of the same size before dealing cards, and the button pays two antes.</p>\n<p>Games are available from NL10 to NL1,000 and PLO20 to PLO2,000; usually, more than 20 tables are being played per format.</p>\n<h3>Tournaments and MTT series</h3>\n<p><img style=\"height: 251px; width: 750px;\" src=\"/uploads/ggpoker tournaments.jpg\" alt=\"ggpoker tournaments\" /></p>\n<p>Every day the site holds dozen of regular events. In addition, the network organizes many tournament series, including unique series in alliance with recognized brands like WSOP, WPT, or APT.</p>\n<p>All regular MTTs are divided into nine fixed groups in the client:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://worldpokerdeals.com/blog/ggpoker-network-is-looking-for-a-new-ambassador\">GG Masters</a> &mdash; special daily grid (including Asia and Double Stack) with over two million dollars guaranteed every week.</li>\n<li>High Rollers &mdash; expensive tournaments with buy-ins from $210 to $5,000 and guaranteed prize pools up to $250,000</li>\n<li>Daily Guarantees &mdash; daily events divided by the blind structure into several color groups. There are three daily Main Events, and the buy-ins range from $2.5 to $250 and GTD prizes from $4,000 &mdash; $60,000</li>\n<li>MILLION$: over 5 million dollars guaranteed every week with a massive Super MILLION$ ME featuring a $10,300 buy-in. The best grinders in the world take part in this event.</li>\n<li>Bounty Hunters &mdash; tournaments with a bounty for knocking out opponents with buy-ins and guarantees for all tastes.</li>\n<li>Omaholic &mdash; Daily events with buy-ins up to $315. Please note that the PLO betting rule will be during pre-flop play in this events, while the No limit betting rule will be applied during post-flop play.</li>\n<li>Chinese Zodiac: a unique schedule played in CNY to attract Asian fans.</li>\n<li>T$ Builder &mdash; poker tournaments without rake held every half hour with prizes in tournament dollars, which can be used in any other MTT of the site.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>GGPoker WSOP Online Series</h4>\n<p>In 2020 GG Poker partnered with the most prestigious poker brand worldwide: World Series of Poker, and successfully hosted the first-ever <a href=\"https://worldpokerdeals.com/blog/ggnetwork-wsop-online-in-july-2020\">WSOP Online Series</a>. The <a href=\"https://worldpokerdeals.com/blog/ggpoker-to-host-the-wsop-main-event\">Main Event</a> mixed live and online poker in a unique event in Las Vegas and Rozvadov.</p>\n<p>All indicate the partnership was fruitful. In 2021, a new series under the WSOP Circuit brand was already played in the fall.</p>\n<h3>Spin &amp; Gold</h3>\n<p>GGPoker launched <a href=\"https://worldpokerdeals.com/blog/spin-gold-the-ultimate-guide-on-ggpoker-network\">Spin&amp;Gold</a> in 2020 with unique features like insurance to avoid playing the X2 multipliers and a maximum prize pool of $2,000,000. The site didn't stop there and in 2021 released <a href=\"https://worldpokerdeals.com/blog/6-max-spin-gold-at-ggpoker-stakes-structure-features\">6-max Spin &amp; Gold</a>. Please note that regular SnG is not available at the moment.</p>\n<p>There are nine stakes available from $0,25 to $200, and according to our reviews, the probabilities are very similar compared to major poker sites like PokerStars.</p>\n<p>Spin &amp; Gold Challenge is the rakeback program where players can get up to 60% cashback by getting gold on the tables.</p>\n<p><strong>Battle Royale</strong></p>\n<p>Hybrid SnG (Flip&amp;Go, fast-fold poker, shootout, PKO) with Dan Bilzerian's image &mdash; <a href=\"https://worldpokerdeals.com/blog/battle-royale-at-ggpoker-what-is-it\">Battle Royale</a> is the latest innovation by GGPoker. There are games from $0.25 to $10 and, we could summarize the game structure as a 100-max PKO SnG awarding prizes to the best 10 players (the winners takes 21.13%).</p>\n<p><strong>Flip &amp; Go</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://worldpokerdeals.com/blog/flip-go-at-ggpoker-what-is-it\">Flip &amp; Go</a> is a tournament designed for players who want to skip the pre-prizes section of the game. At the first stage, all players go all-in automatically until they are all ITM, in which the tournament switches to a regular turbo MTT structure.</p>\n<h2>Game softness</h2>\n<p>It's not easy to evaluate the traffic of a site with so many cash tables. However, we can study the overall environment considering the site's policy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All third-party software is banned</li>\n<li>The indirect rake distribution structure discourages rake machines</li>\n<li>Virtually all promotions are designed for casuals</li>\n<li>Real names are used at high stakes tables</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Comparing the ecosystem rules and our customers&rsquo; feedback and profits, we can conclude that GGPoker has soft traffic overall in cash games and tournaments, except high stakes games in which it is common to find world-famous regs like <a href=\"https://worldpokerdeals.com/blog/wiktor-malinowski-took-down-ggpoker-super-million-for-394-852\">Wiktor Malinowski</a>.</p>\n<h3>GGPoker ambassadors</h3>\n<p>GGTeam is composed of several famous players:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://worldpokerdeals.com/blog/ggpoker-announces-daniel-negreanu-as-brand-ambassador\">Daniel Negreanu</a>: Daniel was a PokerStars ambassador for more than 10 years, and in late 2019, he decided to join the GGPoker team to promote the room. Many of the ideas that Daniel publicly supports, like freezeout tournaments, have been implemented in the platform.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://worldpokerdeals.com/blog/dan-bilzerian-becomes-ggpoker-ambassador\">Dan Bilzerian</a>: A controversial ambassador, mostly known for its eccentric lifestyle rather than its poker talent. GGPoker recruited him in 2020.</li>\n<li>Felipe \"Mojave\" Ramos: The youngest member of the team pro and indeed the bet of the network to attract Latin American customers; Felipe is one of the best Brazilian grinders ever and has been recognized as the Most Inspiring Player.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://worldpokerdeals.com/blog/team-ggpoker-welcomes-elky\">Bertrand \"ElkY\" Grospellier</a>: The French pro joined GGPoker on April 16, 2020. ElkY is a member of the exclusive Triple Crown club for winning EPT, WPT, and WSOP titles.</li>\n<li>Fedor Holz: A German reg that needs no introduction. WSOP champion and over $30 million in profits. He was challenged by Wiktor Malinowski and triumphed in the so-called <a href=\"https://worldpokerdeals.com/blog/limitless-vs-fedor-holz-match-results\">Face-Off Challenge</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In 2021 GG Poker redesigned its team pro and added new branches: TwitchSquad (Kevin Martin), <a href=\"https://worldpokerdeals.com/blog/world-s-first-short-deck-series-1m-gtd-at-ggpoker\">OmahaSquad</a> (Fernando \"JNandez\" Habegger), <a href=\"https://worldpokerdeals.com/blog/world-s-first-short-deck-series-1m-gtd-at-ggpoker\">Short Deck Squad</a> (Denys Chufarin), Team Brazil (Felipe Ramos), Team Russia (Anatoly Filatov), and Team China (Guo Dong).</p>\n<h2>Attitude towards PRO players</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Tracking software&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;no.</li>\n<li>Auto-seating scripts&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;no.</li>\n<li>Pre-flop charts&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;no.</li>\n<li>Bumhunt&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;no.</li>\n<li>Data-mining &ndash; no.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One thing is true regarding GGPoker attitude towards professional players: it's 100% clear. They don't want \"<a href=\"https://worldpokerdeals.com/blog/the-good-pro-the-regular-pro-and-the-bad-pro-by-ggnetwork\">bad pros</a>\" at their tables and clearly state what they expect from regs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To stream their games.</li>\n<li>To promote poker in any way (blogs, podcasts, etc.)</li>\n<li>To play following all the rules, including not using any third-party software, GTO tools like printed charts, and avoiding bumhunting and similar practices at the tables.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We have heard many histories about blocked players at GGPoker, but it seems all cases are related to infractions to <a href=\"https://worldpokerdeals.com/blog/poker-rooms-vs-grinders-terms-and-conditions-exposed\">terms and conditions</a>. The <a href=\"https://worldpokerdeals.com/blog/why-did-ggpoker-confiscate-180k-from-tobias-dudd1-duthweiler\">Tobias Duthweiler</a> banning case reached the headlines, but he returned to the tables even after the site seized his funds.</p>\n<h2>Software review</h2>\n<p><img style=\"height: 449px; width: 750px;\" src=\"/uploads/ggpoker client.jpg\" alt=\"ggpoker client\" /></p>\n<p>GG Poker client is available for Windows, Mac OS, Android, and iOS. The software used by all the skins is the same one (only the logos and some exclusive promotions are different), and it's state-of-the-art poker platform that meets and even exceeds the modern requirements.</p>\n<p>GGPoker client is powered with many exciting features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://worldpokerdeals.com/blog/snapcam-share-a-video-reaction-on-ggnetwork\">SnapCam</a>: share short videos at the tables</li>\n<li>Bubble Protection: early birds will recover the buy-in if they get finish close to the bubble</li>\n<li>Emoji: Negreanu or ElkY will dance for everyone when reaching a final table</li>\n<li>No Look All-in: players and answer a straddle with a blind all-in</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://worldpokerdeals.com/blog/staking-at-pokerok-ggnetwork\">Staking</a>: buy shares of any player for any MTT, including big series</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>GGPoker Network prohibits the use of any additional software</strong> <strong>(trackers, automated seating tools, HUDs, etc.).</strong></p>\n<p>Therefore, the client has two built-in features to give more information about the game:</p>\n<p>SmartHUD: statistics on opponents.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://worldpokerdeals.com/blog/the-new-gg-poker-network-6-hold-em-hand-histories-and-more\">PokerCraft</a>: information about your own game.</p>\n<p>PokerCraft gives access to download your hand history. Such HH can be added to tracking software to conduct post-session reviews. Please note that GGPoker hand history deletes information about the villains, so you'll only be able to study your game.</p>\n<p><img style=\"height: 360px; width: 750px;\" src=\"/uploads/ggpoker pokercraft.jpg\" alt=\"pokerCraft\" /></p>\n<h2>Mobile app</h2>\n<p>GGPoker has native clients for iOS and Android gadgets. The user interface is well designed and allows joining up to four simultaneous games in portrait (vertical) mode. Curiously, you'll need to reach customer service to get an up-to-date link. Apple users must install an extra profile.</p>\n<p>What's to highlight about GG Poker mobile app? It has been polished for fitting in any gadget and grants access to all games on the network (hello WPN).
